# Showing the Highest Number in the Output from a Text File
Problem 2 in Assignment 4
# Problem
```bash
Writing a Python Program that reads a text file that contains 20 students name with their general weighted average, and creating a program that will output a highest GWA of the students, it should show the name of the students and its grade.
```
# About the Program 
With this program, it felt familiar to me having this code but eventually it just a quite small of idea of this program, so still I find the right methods to use. Also, I clearly understand now, how other functions should work. Again, it is great practice!
# Installation
pycharm64.exe
# Usage
line.strip() - it removes the whitespace from the beginning and at the end of the string.
line.split() - returns a list of the words in the string or line, separated by the delimeter string.
float() - returns the value based on the argument or parameter value that is being passed to it.
# Launch
