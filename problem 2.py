# write a python program that contains 20 students with their general weighted average, then, read the text file
# and create a program that will output the name of the student which have the highest gwa,
# including its grades in the output.

# pseudocode
# create a text file that contains names and gwa of 20 students
# open the text file and read it
with open("students_name_gwa.txt", "r") as problem_two_numbers_file:
# set the variables
# construct the loop with related various methods
# recognize each line having two variables
# establish the two variables to one
# convert the gwa to float
# check the gwa line by line to get the highest gwa and its name of the student
# define the variables
# run the program
# print the output
